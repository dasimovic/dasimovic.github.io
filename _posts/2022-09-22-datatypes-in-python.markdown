Datatypes are the most important concept in programming. In fact, data types are the fundament of every program. Understanding the concepts of datatypes will not only speed up the learning curve when it comes to learn to program. Understanding the concept of datatypes will make the code written more stable and gives a better understanding about what is happening with the information processed in program code.

What are datatypes?
Datatypes can be described as storage types for information. Every piece of information is stored into datatypes. Some programming languages expect that the datatype is defined before it can be used in the code. Python for example does not require the definition of datatypes before variables can be used. The more it is important for developers to understand what datatypes are used for especially when the programming language of choice does not force to define the datatypes. In Python for example:

Int = Defines an integer. An integer is a whole number without decimal. For example 3, 10, -1 

float = Defines an float. An Float is a number which contains a decimal. For example 1.0, -0.8., .2 

str = Defines an string. Everything surrounded by double or single quotes is a string. For example: “Hello” ‘World’. Hello is a string and World is a string

Bool = Represents True or False. True is 1 and False is 0 in binary code.

None = Represents emptiness and ca be used us a placeholder for variables before information is stored
